Extremely lowbrow loadout randomizer for Helldivers 2 by Arrowhead studios.

To use:

    Put the HD2Randomizer.exe and HD2_WarBondExclusions.txt file in some folder on your computer.
    Run the .exe file from the command prompt, and it will generate a random Primary, Secondary, and Throwable weapons setup.

Additional arguments may be provided to the .exe file to modify behaviour;

    --help (--h); displays a list of commands.
    --list (--ls); displays a list of all Warbonds (to-date)
    -warbondname; use this to exclude a Warbond (that you don't own, for instance) from future randomizer runs. This list is stored in the HD2_WarBondExclusions.txt text file.
    +warbondname; (re)include a given Warbond in the randomizer (if you bought something new, or reconsidered). You can also manually remove the line of text from the exclusion file.

Remember not to use spaces when typing in a Warbond name, e.g. "ServantsOfFreedom"
